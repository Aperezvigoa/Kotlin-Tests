# Kotlin Library Management System

This is a simple library management system implemented in Kotlin. It allows users to:

* Register books with titles, authors, and categories.
* Register library members with names and unique IDs.
* Lend books to members.
* Return books from members.
* Search for books by title or author.

## Features

* **Object-Oriented Design:**  Utilizes classes (`Book`, `Partner`, `Library`) to represent entities and their interactions.
* **Data Structures:**  Employs lists to manage collections of books and members.
* **Enum Usage:**  Uses an enum (`BookCategory`) to define book categories.
* **User Input:**  Handles user input and provides basic validation.
* **Core Functionality:**  Implements core library management functions like lending, returning, and searching for books.
